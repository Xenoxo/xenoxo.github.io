<p>You know, at this point I should just adjust these to come out mid week. But let&rsquo;s see if I can&rsquo;t shift things around.</p>
<p>Leading up to this post there was one part I was struggling with. More specifically, it was diving deep into a tutorial video on root motion animation.</p>
<p>There were some very severe mental barriers present when I was originally considering the video. Thinking back, I believe it stems from my discomfort as it relates to animation and subsequent related topics.</p>
<p>Of all the major areas in the engine so far, this seems to &ldquo;scare&rdquo; me the most. Really unsure what it is about it. However, like any other topics or domains, once I got into it, things really began to flow. Sure there were moments of frustration, but it really wasn&rsquo;t any different than the frustration I&rsquo;ve felt before.</p>

<p>A relatively large milestone achieved this week. I was able to follow a youtube guide on AI root animation.</p>
<p>At this point I actually have the system written in Blueprints, however there are major pieces of it I don&rsquo;t fully understand. So my intention is to translate all this into c++, and by doing so, familiarize myself with the pieces.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

<p>The most complicated part has actually been handling how the zombie will move towards the player. After following a great tutorial on this exact idea, I was finally able to solve the problem I had around trying to get the enemy to move at the player in a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; way.</p>
<p>Additional work went into creating a stop radius and handling the zombie&rsquo;s turn towards facing the player while in that range.</p>
<p>Once I&rsquo;m done translating this to c++, my next goal is to set up health and dying for the enemy. Until next time!</p>
<p>Side note: I&rsquo;ve been struggling through typing on my new glove 80 keyboard, and although I feel awkward using it still, it&rsquo;s a stark difference to when I started.</p>
