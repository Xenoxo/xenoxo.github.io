<p>I am typing this post on my new split ergonomic keyboard and man am I having a hell of a time. That previous sentence took me over a minute to write.</p>
<p>Given the new layout of the keyboard, I suddenly feel as if my brain is getting muscle cramps. I keep feeling the battle between my muscle memory, gliding my fingers to where they &ldquo;should&rdquo; go and the unexpected jolt of seeing an unexpected character show up.</p>
<p>I did a typing test to gauge the speed difference between my normal keyboard and this new one and oh man, it&rsquo;s embarrassing to say the least.</p>
<p><img src="/images/week04-typespeed.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>Though I will admit that there is a certain level of fun to learning this new keyboard as I type. However, for the sake of my sanity, I am going to keep this post short.</p>
<h1 id="game-updates">Game Updates</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added a number of changes and improvements since the last update. Most importantly, I&rsquo;ve created a basic system that handles the bulletspread (as shown by the aim reticle) based on different player states.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbzDfINWPS4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
</p>
<p>Most of the work was reworking the existing way I had handled linetraces. For a variety of reasons, my initial attempt was largely correct, but had serious issues when trying to adapt it to a variable bulletspread radius.</p>
<h1 id="meta-game-dev-thoughts">Meta Game Dev Thoughts</h1>
<p>Changing the underlying system took well over 7 hours of my time. However, the vast majority of that time was spent understanding why it wasn&rsquo;t working. The actual change was maybe 45 minutes.</p>
<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s how these things go.</p>
<p>Also, I found a great video about solo game dev processes known as &ldquo;Production Point&rdquo;</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NsMHicoZTzQ" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>I will certainly try and incorporate this into my own processes.</p>
<h2 id="mental-musings">Mental Musings</h2>
<p>It still feels like there is just so much out there for me to do. I suppose I need to accept this feeling.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder what exactly it is about games that makes them so captive to people like myself. Then I like to ponder about what I could accomplish if I had the same interest / drive I have for these types of games but applied to some real life goal.</p>
<p>In some ways, I&rsquo;m trying to do it with my game dev. Perhaps that day will never come where my interest wells up to the level that a well made game makes me feel, but as I&rsquo;ve not sincerely pursued something with all my heart for some time, I won&rsquo;t be able to say for sure until I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
