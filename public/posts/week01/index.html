<p>This post is late due to work related delays (in the future I&rsquo;ll have something out each Sunday), but I&rsquo;m commited to writing a post a week so here&rsquo;s me shoehorning one in.</p>

<p>Still not totally sure on what the game will be, but at this point my goal is to get a character that can shoot set up. High level next step would be to set up enemies that the player can affect.</p>
<p>Then the last mechanism will be a basic interaction system to loot enemies for ammo and interact with doors/objects.</p>
<p>Stretch goals will be porting over the inventory system I made in &ldquo;Derp and Derper&rdquo; and build out some base loot system.</p>
<p>One step at a time.</p>
<h2 id="meta-game-dev-thoughts">Meta Game Dev Thoughts</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how big of difference utilizing skills on my own versus following a tutorial is.</p>
<p>Even right now, I go through moments of frustation as I encounter certain things that I know I&rsquo;ve done before but - for the life of me - can&rsquo;t recall how exactly to do it. As unenjoyable as this feeling is, I continue to use this as a guidepost and indicator that I&rsquo;m learning.</p>
<p>The engine itself is marvelous. Say what you will about the Unreal Engine, but having software of this complexity and capability for free is something I don&rsquo;t appreciate enough.</p>
<p>From a C++ perspective, I think I&rsquo;ve grasped the fundamentals fairly solidly at this point. I&rsquo;ve managed to <a href="https://www.tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-cpp-guide/">read this entire C++ guide</a> and to my delight understand more than 75% of it.</p>
<p>That said, there is so much to learn yet.</p>
<p>Knowing the fundamentals of a language feels like I know every letter of the alphabet, but the actual words I can create and their meanings are still a mystery. Google (and guides like the one above) are my go-to&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Until next post.</p>
