<p>Long story short, I&rsquo;ve had one of the most insane weeks in recent memory. Work alone was bad enough but a number of other unforseen circumstances all perfectly aligned to ensure I had no time to work on my game.</p>
<p>Despite it all, I&rsquo;ve managed to enough progress to complete a major piece of the game.</p>

<p>This week saw me completing the hit reaction piece for the zombie characters.</p>
<p>Now when hit by a shot they&rsquo;ll react to it and with enough shots they&rsquo;ll die&hellip;and at least for now, with a pretty entertaining finish.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZFiebGGFBY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>The hardest part of all of this was handling the specific interactions based on where I hit on the enemy character.</p>
<p>At first I was handling this by adding a temporary rotational offset to the bone hit.</p>
<p>However, on issue with this solution is that it becomes quite complicated with all the different bones. For instance hitting the head and having it &ldquo;tilt&rdquo; back 45 degrees looks good, however I would want a different degree for the chest and limbs. As with most things I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a smart way to handle this&hellip;but at my current level and need, I abandoned this idea in favor of the more common &ldquo;enable physics&rdquo; path.</p>
<p>In short my solution is to enable physics specifically for that bone and child bones when hit. Additionally an impulse is applied in the direction of the bullet&rsquo;s path. Finally a blend takes place back to the animatuion over a second of so.</p>
<p>This created a pretty good effect of the zombie&rsquo;s limbs reacting to the hit but not totally thrown out of their animation. Also I swapped out the gun sparks for blood which lends to the &ldquo;realism&rdquo;.</p>
