There&amp;rsquo;s a lot going on here, so let me break it down.</description>

      <description>Why am I like this? You know, it&amp;rsquo;s funny. I was unemployed for more than half the year in 2023.&#xA;During that time, I had ample freedom to do whatever I wanted, and by god if working on Unreal wasn&amp;rsquo;t something on my mind everyday. But that&amp;rsquo;s just it - it was merely on my mind. Mostly serving as some kind of fiendish reminder of my inability to do what I know I can and should.</description>

      <description>Hitting the Ground Crawling This post is late due to work related delays (in the future I&amp;rsquo;ll have something out each Sunday), but I&amp;rsquo;m commited to writing a post a week so here&amp;rsquo;s me shoehorning one in.&#xA;Game Still not totally sure on what the game will be, but at this point my goal is to get a character that can shoot set up. High level next step would be to set up enemies that the player can affect.</description>

      <description>Something something new beginnings&amp;hellip; The intention of this blog is to mainly serve as a way for me to keep myself on track this year for my game development efforts. While I don&amp;rsquo;t have a detailed fleshed goals for this year (yet), I know that spending a meaningful amount of time on game development will be one of them.&#xA;Each post will provide an update about the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made in the past week both at a high level, and if encountering something particularly interesting during development, likely involve a deeper techincal dive.</description>
