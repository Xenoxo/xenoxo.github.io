<p>I&rsquo;ve had a particularly busy week at work. That said, I&rsquo;ve stil managed to make some progress in my game.</p>
<p>Although if I am being honest, it&rsquo;s quite frustrating seeing how little progress I&rsquo;ve managed to make.</p>
<p>In these times, I try to remember and look back to see how far I&rsquo;ve traveled. And although it doesn&rsquo;t totally resolve the frustration, it&rsquo;s enough to reduce the intensity.</p>
<h1 id="game-updates">Game Updates</h1>
<p>This past week and some-odd days saw me focus on AI. Not the generative kind, but the videogame &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; kinds.</p>
<p>I was able to get the enemy to &ldquo;see&rdquo; the player using the built in AIPerception class. Additionally, I created some basic follow and attack behavior.</p>
<p>I also took a foray into BehaviorTrees and the associated systems. I know I&rsquo;ll need to go deep into that area one day, I decided that as a matter of getting some sort of game out, I&rsquo;ll hold off and implement my AI in more crude ways.</p>
<p>Going to keep pushing forward. Small steps each day, it&rsquo;s the only way to success.</p>
