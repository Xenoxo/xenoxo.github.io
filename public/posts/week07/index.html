<p>Not sure what it is but I keep pushing these out later and later. Had I not written this today well&hellip;it would have been actually a total miss.</p>
<p>I hate to use work as the excuse but it certainly is quite draining, especially when its intense like this week. However I am grateful that I get to work on my game this weekend.</p>
<p>Time seems to have a strange quality to it. When you move towards either ends of &ldquo;extreme fun&rdquo; or &ldquo;extreme focus&rdquo; the perception of time similarly speeds up. The main difference being one makes you feel good and the other bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m observing this in myself as I continue to work on the game.</p>
<h1 id="game-updates">Game Updates</h1>
<p>This past week saw me trying to implement a simple &ldquo;hit reaction&rdquo; element to the zombie when the player shoots them.</p>
<p>As you will see in the following video, the underlying basics are there, though with some hilarious results.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqRyHG8gi7Q" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Essentially I&rsquo;ve got the underlying logic to work to create a change in the mesh driven by a player event. The next steps are to adjust the mesh angle to reflect what I am really going for.</p>
<p>Now obviously as this post is almost a whole week late, I&rsquo;ve since figured out how to do that (though not in an ideal way) however, that and more will be revealed next time.</p>
