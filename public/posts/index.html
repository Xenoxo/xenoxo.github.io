      Progress Admist The Chaos Long story short, I&rsquo;ve had one of the most insane weeks in recent memory. Work alone was bad enough but a number of other unforseen circumstances all perfectly aligned to ensure I had no time to work on my game.
Despite it all, I&rsquo;ve managed to enough progress to complete a major piece of the game.
Game Updates This week saw me completing the hit reaction piece for the zombie characters.

      Talk About Procrastination Not sure what it is but I keep pushing these out later and later. Had I not written this today well&hellip;it would have been actually a total miss.
I hate to use work as the excuse but it certainly is quite draining, especially when its intense like this week. However I am grateful that I get to work on my game this weekend.
Time seems to have a strange quality to it.

      Thursday Is The New Last Sunday You know, at this point I should just adjust these to come out mid week. But let&rsquo;s see if I can&rsquo;t shift things around.
Leading up to this post there was one part I was struggling with. More specifically, it was diving deep into a tutorial video on root motion animation.
There were some very severe mental barriers present when I was originally considering the video.

      Busy Days I&rsquo;ve had a particularly busy week at work. That said, I&rsquo;ve stil managed to make some progress in my game.
Although if I am being honest, it&rsquo;s quite frustrating seeing how little progress I&rsquo;ve managed to make.
In these times, I try to remember and look back to see how far I&rsquo;ve traveled. And although it doesn&rsquo;t totally resolve the frustration, it&rsquo;s enough to reduce the intensity.
Game Updates This past week and some-odd days saw me focus on AI.

      Brains Are Weird I am typing this post on my new split ergonomic keyboard and man am I having a hell of a time. That previous sentence took me over a minute to write.
Given the new layout of the keyboard, I suddenly feel as if my brain is getting muscle cramps. I keep feeling the battle between my muscle memory, gliding my fingers to where they &ldquo;should&rdquo; go and the unexpected jolt of seeing an unexpected character show up.

      Technically Still Counts Well this post is a tad (5 days) late. That said, I&rsquo;m still keeping to the 1 post a week schedule! Also changing the overall structure of this an all foreseeable future posts. Going to start with the gaming updates and then get into personal thoughts Here we go!
Game Progress I&rsquo;ve worked through several &ldquo;features&rdquo; since the last post. There&rsquo;s a lot going on here, so let me break it down.

      Why am I like this? You know, it&rsquo;s funny. I was unemployed for more than half the year in 2023.
During that time, I had ample freedom to do whatever I wanted, and by god if working on Unreal wasn&rsquo;t something on my mind everyday. But that&rsquo;s just it - it was merely on my mind. Mostly serving as some kind of fiendish reminder of my inability to do what I know I can and should.

      Hitting the Ground Crawling This post is late due to work related delays (in the future I&rsquo;ll have something out each Sunday), but I&rsquo;m commited to writing a post a week so here&rsquo;s me shoehorning one in.
Game Still not totally sure on what the game will be, but at this point my goal is to get a character that can shoot set up. High level next step would be to set up enemies that the player can affect.

      Something something new beginnings&hellip; The intention of this blog is to mainly serve as a way for me to keep myself on track this year for my game development efforts. While I don&rsquo;t have a detailed fleshed goals for this year (yet), I know that spending a meaningful amount of time on game development will be one of them.
Each post will provide an update about the progress I&rsquo;ve made in the past week both at a high level, and if encountering something particularly interesting during development, likely involve a deeper techincal dive.
