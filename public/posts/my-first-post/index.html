<p>The intention of this blog is to mainly serve as a way for me to keep myself on track this year for my game development efforts. While I don&rsquo;t have a detailed fleshed goals for this year (yet), I know that spending a meaningful amount of time on game development will be one of them.</p>
<p>Each post will provide an update about the progress I&rsquo;ve made in the past week both at a high level, and if encountering something particularly interesting during development, likely involve a deeper techincal dive.</p>
<p>This initial post is a kickoff for the effort, and will be more introspective than most (though this is subject to change). If game development updates is more to your liking, skip ahead to the next post!</p>
<p>This blog was really spurred on by my recent completion of the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/">Unreal Engine C++ course on Udemy.</a></p>
<p>I gave a full review of it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/18yn4pw/i_just_finished_the_52_hour_ue_5_c_udemy_course/">here on reddit</a>.</p>
<p>The course was quite a good dive into Unreal Engine and more importantly, the C++ side of it all. Stretching well over 50 hours in instructions, I realized upon completion that this was one of the most in depth periods of learning that I&rsquo;ve done in many years. Oh sure I learn things at work and also pick up knowledge about things here and there, but it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve voluntarily dedicated my free time to learning something challenging.</p>
<p>So what game am I making? Well for now, I think I&rsquo;ll go ahead with building a simple 3rd person shooter. This should allow me to utilize most of the learnings throughout the course as well as add some funcitonality of my own.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes!</p>
