<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny. I was unemployed for more than half the year in 2023.</p>
<p>During that time, I had ample freedom to do whatever I wanted, and by god if working on Unreal wasn&rsquo;t something on my mind everyday. But that&rsquo;s just it - it was merely on my mind. Mostly serving as some kind of fiendish reminder of my inability to do what I know I can and should.</p>
<p>It was just so difficult to get into it and perhaps conversely, SO EASY to just not do it and do something else. So I did. Something else that is.</p>
<p>I probably made about as much progress in my Unreal journey during that entire period as I did during the whole of December last year.</p>
<p>I think about this now as I wade through neck deep in work and long for a period of respite to focus on my Unreal work. I have made up my mind that this is likely not going to happen for sometime. So instead I must utilize what time I have left.</p>
<p>Because my god do I want to minimize the amount of &ldquo;Quarterly Sync&rdquo; meetings for the remainder of my life.</p>
<p><em>A step a day.</em></p>
<h2 id="game-progress">Game Progress</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve broken through several &ldquo;barriers&rdquo; since last I wrote.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZasJBBd0YQM" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p><strong>Some changes in no certain order:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Additional animations for firing and reloading (Character and Gun)</li>
<li>Implemented Aim offset (makes the character follow and aim where you point the camera)</li>
<li>Added basic mechanism around ammo and equally basic UI</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="meta-game-thoughts">Meta Game Thoughts</h2>
<p>Sometimes I get overwhelmed looking at posts or videos of other people&rsquo;s work in Unreal. Despite what I know (very little) seeing all this progress makes it feel like I haven&rsquo;t advanced my understanding at all.</p>
<p>Obviously this is false.</p>
<p>But I so often forget to look where I came from and instead look to where others are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled through the MUCK of concussion inducing lessons in Unreal to grasp at what I could.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set aside the time and attention to learn the basic of C++ for Unreal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m far from where I want to be. But I&rsquo;m also far from where I began.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>
