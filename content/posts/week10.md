# Getting Back In The Rhythm
As I mentioned yesterday, there's really not much to show right now. I'm making decent progress transferring the Blueprint logic into C++ so far.

As I'm doing this, I think it'll be sometime before I am able to fully understand when to use Blueprints, C++ or a mix.

For now, I like the idea of prototyping and figuring out things in BP to translate them into C++ afterwards.

Though I'm far from an engineer at this point, there is great enjoyment in the sense of mastery that comes from learning and applying the concepts I've learned so far.

It always seems like I have so much ahead, however, I must continually remind myself to look back and see where I came from.

Only late last year did I begin to seriously learn Unreal, and though my time to actually work on this has shortened, the progress I've made in my knowledge is something I'm proud of.

# New Game
So then, what's this new game I'm working on?

For now the concept is quite broad. We're aiming to build a 3rd person zombie shooter set in the late 1800's England.

The player will control a tavern owner who will serve drinks by day and dungeon delve at night.

Given that it's the first game, it'll likely not be great. But this craft, like many others, is a game of quantity which inevitably leads to quality.
