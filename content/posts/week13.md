# Delays
Long story short I've had a week of successfully pushing off the work I need to do in Unreal. On one hand I can blame it on work or how my neck randomly started to really hurt (as if I'd pulled it) mid week.

However, I've had more than enough time today to make headway on my projects and yet...here we are.

It's not that I haven't made progress this week but just that my day today was not used well. 

I had a plan around creating an actual edited video with everything that I've done, but there definitely won't be enough time to have that done.

I'm dissapointed in myself mostly because it seems that when given a day to do whatever I want, I have a really hard time advancing the things I know I should. While this isn't new in general, it speaks ill of my intentions to "go solo" and do this full time...

If all my time is controlled by me, I fear that my time management skills today is not up to the task. 

But like all skills, this can be improved. I'm grateful for this opportunity to improve this aspect of my life.

Okay - back to the grind.
