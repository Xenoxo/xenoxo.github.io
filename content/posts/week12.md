# Refactoring Continues
This past 2 weeks has seen a the completion of the refactoring work for the zombie character.

In addition to the original logic, I've now am utilizing the physics body of the character.

This was another experiment where I knew that this technique would be helpful, but my total lack of experience held me off from actually starting. But I'm glad I did.

Given this new system, it is quite satisfying when the zombie is killed. There are definitely improvements that I can make there, however I must keep reminding myself my current goal is to get to a playable state with a game.

To that end...

Additional improvements were made to damage and I've also begun the seed of the attack / combat system. Also I'am in the process of changing from the Unreal default Mannequin to another asset. There must be an easier way to do this because I'm spending a lot of time correcting errors that are a result of this change.

# Flow and Frustration
It's interesting these days as I alternate between total flow state and total frustration state. For example, I'm currently tweaking animations to ensure a proper retarget - however there was one issue that I solved in about 5 minutes, but took me well over 2 hours to figure out.

When things are going well though, I definitely enter a sort of flow state - something I'm very grateful to experience when pursuing something that I find interesting and is something that allows me to create.

# Next Up
Well I'll likely write another entry on Monday - with a fairly comprehensive video.

But between now and then I intend to finalize my character, add some basic game elements (like health, etc).

My stretch goal by Monday is to have a very basic game ready...double stretch goal will be a packaged game that's on twitch for my friends to download.
