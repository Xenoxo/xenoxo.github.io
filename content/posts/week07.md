#Talk About Procrastination

Not sure what it is but I keep pushing these out later and later. Had I not written this today well...it would have been actually a total miss.

I hate to use work as the excuse but it certainly is quite draining, especially when its intense like this week. However I am grateful that I get to work on my game this weekend.

Time seems to have a strange quality to it. When you move towards either ends of "extreme fun" or "extreme focus" the perception of time similarly speeds up. The main difference being one makes you feel good and the other bad.

I'm observing this in myself as I continue to work on the game.

#Game Updates
This past week saw me trying to implement a simple "hit reaction" element to the zombie when the player shoots them.

As you will see in the following video, the underlying basics are there, though with some hilarious results.

Essentially I've got the underlying logic to work to create a change in the mesh driven by a player event. The next steps are to adjust the mesh angle to reflect what I am really going for.

Now obviously as this post is almost a whole week late, I've since figured out how to do that (though not in an ideal way) however, that and more will be revealed next time.
