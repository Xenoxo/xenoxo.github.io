# Why am I like this?

You know, it's funny. I was unemployed for more than half the year in 2023.

During that time, I had ample freedom to do whatever I wanted, and by god if working on Unreal wasn't something on my mind everyday. But that's just it - it was merely on my mind. Mostly serving as some kind of fiendish reminder of my inability to do what I know I can and should.

It was just so difficult to get into it and perhaps conversely, SO EASY to just not do it and do something else. So I did. Something else that is.

I probably made about as much progress in my Unreal journey during that entire period as I did during the whole of December last year.

I think about this now as I wade through neck deep in work and long for a period of respite to focus on my Unreal work. I have made up my mind that this is likely not going to happen for sometime. So instead I must utilize what time I have left.

Because my god do I want to minimize the amount of "Quarterly Sync" meetings for the remainder of my life.

*A step a day.*

## Game Progress

I've broken through several "barriers" since last I wrote.

**Some changes in no certain order:**
* Additional animations for firing and reloading (Character and Gun)
* Implemented Aim offset (makes the character follow and aim where you point the camera)
* Added basic mechanism around ammo and equally basic UI

## Meta Game Thoughts
Sometimes I get overwhelmed looking at posts or videos of other people's work in Unreal. Despite what I know (very little) seeing all this progress makes it feel like I haven't advanced my understanding at all.

Obviously this is false.

But I so often forget to look where I came from and instead look to where others are.

I've struggled through the MUCK of concussion inducing lessons in Unreal to grasp at what I could.

I've set aside the time and attention to learn the basic of C++ for Unreal.

I'm far from where I want to be. But I'm also far from where I began.

Until next time!
