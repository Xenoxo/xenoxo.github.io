# Hitting the Ground Crawling

This post is late due to work related delays (in the future I'll have something out each Sunday), but I'm commited to writing a post a week so here's me shoehorning one in.

## Game

Still not totally sure on what the game will be, but at this point my goal is to get a character that can shoot set up. High level next step would be to set up enemies that the player can affect.

Then the last mechanism will be a basic interaction system to loot enemies for ammo and interact with doors/objects.

Stretch goals will be porting over the inventory system I made in "Derp and Derper" and build out some base loot system.

One step at a time.

## Meta Game Dev Thoughts

It's funny how big of difference utilizing skills on my own versus following a tutorial is.

Even right now, I go through moments of frustation as I encounter certain things that I know I've done before but - for the life of me - can't recall how exactly to do it. As unenjoyable as this feeling is, I continue to use this as a guidepost and indicator that I'm learning.

The engine itself is marvelous. Say what you will about the Unreal Engine, but having software of this complexity and capability for free is something I don't appreciate enough. 

From a C++ perspective, I think I've grasped the fundamentals fairly solidly at this point. I've managed to [read this entire C++ guide](https://www.tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-cpp-guide/) and to my delight understand more than 75% of it.

That said, there is so much to learn yet. 

Knowing the fundamentals of a language feels like I know every letter of the alphabet, but the actual words I can create and their meanings are still a mystery. Google (and guides like the one above) are my go-to's.

Until next post.
